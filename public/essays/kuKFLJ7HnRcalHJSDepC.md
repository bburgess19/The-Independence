Going back to our past  
Creates memories that will ever last  
Bequeath to the next generations  
Baton of the tales of emancipation
Here's our turn  
It's our time to learn  
At the door of no return  
In the algorithms of anguish that sail concern  
Our souls encoded on a transatlantic return  
From shadows of oblivion, a dawn of hope unfurls  
13 million hearts in lands of unknown like pearls  
Amidst the vast, we find a home, our dream a million swirls  
Across the sea, in chains we came, torn from sun-kissed shores,  
Children from the East, West, and South cries forevermore.  
Land of palms, a stolen birth, sweat and sorrow tilled the earth,  
Yet in our hearts, a flame did burn, a fight for freedom's destined turn.

From Marcus Garvey's dream, a trumpet blown,  
Martin Luther King's voice with echoes of its own,  
Kwame Nkrumah's fire, Uhuru Kenyatta's stand,  
Nanny's blade in a fierce hand. Nelson Mandela's Magic.  
George Padmore's pen, Norman Manley's soul,  
Toussaint L'Ouverture's drum beat to make whole,  
Rawle Douglin, Paul Bogle, Eric Williams bold,  
stories etched in the ages old.

Tears that watered hope's bright seed,  
whispers carried on the breeze,  
A tale of sacrifice, woven on bended knees.  
From sugar cane to city streets,  
voices rising, strong and sweet,  
Black diamonds glinting in the sun,  
breaking chains, the battle won.

Maroons in mountains, spirits free,  
echoes of rebellion in every tree,  
Freedom's fortress, built with pride,  
where the river kissed the mountainside.  
Their song inspires, their courage calls,  
the spirit of defiance never falls,  
In every step, in every word,  
their legacy, a soaring bird.

Though sadness lingers, whispers low,  
of stolen years, of pain aglow,  
Hope's sunrise paints the dawning sky,  
wings of freedom stretch and fly.  
In laughter's ring, in drumbeat's call,  
we rise above, stand tall, stand tall,  
Children of the great land of Africa and the Caribbeans,  
hear freedom's call!

From stolen shores to lands we claim,  
voices echo, spirits aflame,  
Black roots weave a sorrow, resilience whispers through the sea.  
We are the song, the dance, the drum,  
the echoes of battles overcome,  
In every heart, a freedom's song,  
where we belong, where we belong.  
Across oceans, through chains we came,  
Traded as property, our worth proclaimed,  
But in our hearts, they held on to hope,  
A resilient spirit, beyond any ropes.

Generations passed, scars still remain,  
But our children rise, breaking the chains,  
Gathered here as one, their past they share,  
A bond that unites, beyond compare.

With pride they look, at where they came,  
And with determination, they declare their aim,  
To build a future, that holds no shame,  
For their past now guides them, to a brighter flame.

The children of contemporary Africa,  
And those of African descent,  
Together we stand, with hope and grace,  
Our past directing, our present.

No longer will we dwell, in shame, sorrow or distress,  
Instead, we rise, with resilience and finesse,  
For our ancestors, we'll make them proud,  
Their legacy lives on, in us, aloud.
