The Civil Rights and Women's Liberation movements have actively contributed to the advancement of social justice. The practices and attitudes that correspond to these movements have historically failed to address the intersectionality of race and gender. The Combahee River Collective, Bell Hooks, and Audre Lorde present alternative frameworks that contest interlocking systems of white supremacy and patriarchy. Their literature underscores the significance of recognizing and embracing difference, cultivating political consciousness, and mobilizing collective action to address hegemonic systems of power. This essay explores their critiques, delving into the role that Black feminism can play in dismantling all forms of oppression.

The Combahee River Collective emerged in response to the growing disillusionment with past social justice movements, specifically the Civil Rights and Feminist movements of the 1960s. According to the Collective, both movements failed to adequately address the experiences and concerns of Black women, neglecting the intersecting dimensions of race, gender, and class in oppression. This isolation led to a movement towards “identity politics”, which locates individual experience as an critical source of information (Combahee). Black feminists use identity politics to address their grievances and concerns directly. This produces a political project that is both anti-racist and anti-sexist (Combahee). The Collective acknowledges that the only people who have the necessary amount of care to commit to this work are Black women themselves.

The identified relationship dynamics between Black women and their peers color the critique waged against past liberation movements. The Collective critique of the Civil Rights Movement pinpoints the underlying sexism between Black men and Black women. Black men are shown to be threatened by the idea of Black feminism (Combahee). They are wary of any attention away from the problems of the entire race, and neglect to prioritize the critical needs of Black women (Combahee). This refusal to address the intersectionality of oppressions perpetuates the erasure of Black women's voices and concerns.

The Collective also identifies the deep disconnect between Black women and white women. White women are shown to make little effort towards dismantling racial hegemony. They do not possess nor attempt to possess a well-rounded comprehension of race, class, and other systems of power outside of the patriarchy (Combahee). The Collective criticizes the Women's Liberation Movement for its inability to acknowledge and confront the racial inequalities faced by women of color. White feminism is shown to center the struggles of white, middle-class women, largely disregarding the experiences of Black women and other women of color (Combahee). This exclusionary approach further reinforces the interlocking systems of white supremacy and patriarchy, limiting the feminist movement's potential for transformative change.

Bell Hooks expands on these critiques, acknowledging the direct role that white women play in the preservation of hegemonic forms of oppression. Hooks pays attention to the socialization of white women, noting how systems of education have led to brainwashing that has resulted in their self-imposed isolation. This reluctance to immerse themselves outside their white bubble has resulted in many failures within feminist movements. By holding on to the principles of white supremacy, white feminists detract from the principles governing their “radical rhetoric” (Hooks).

White women are shown clinging to white supremacy as a route towards uplift. By drawing connections to Black women, white women feel that their status would be undermined. This imposed isolation away from women of color suppresses a movement towards intersectionality (Hooks). As Hooks describes, the archetypes that personify the word "woman" prioritize white narratives. This “racist-sexist tendency” allows white women to define white men as the oppressor while simultaneously rejecting coalition with women of color (Hooks). This term also makes room for a possible alliance between white and non-white women to deflect attention away from their classism and racism.

Rather than using these differences to divide us, Audre Lorde calls for different oppressed groups to "define and conquer," celebrating our differences. Lorde argues that both the Civil Rights movement and the White feminist tradition neglect the complexities sprung from the intersections of race and gender. According to Lorde, a limited understanding of differences limits the ability to make coalitions. By “misnaming” our categorical difference, we train ourselves to penalize any concept of “other” (Lorde). This concept is exemplified through Audre Lorde's identity as a Black lesbian. She is constantly encouraged "to pluck out some one aspect of [herself] and present this as the meaningful whole," providing a one-dimensional glimpse of her personhood (Lorde). Lorde articulates this lived experience to personify the past social movements' understanding of difference. There is an apparent propensity to either define difference as an "insurmountable barrier" or avoid its existence altogether (Lorde). This inkling produces a "human deviance" towards the celebration of intersectionality.

Both the feminist movement and the Civil Rights movement are shown to neglect the "interdependence of mutual (non-dominant) differences," disregarding the dimensionality of human beings (Lorde). Lorde argues that these various identities that we embody shape our experiences and oppressions in distinct ways, bringing forth the need for more collaborative social movements. Difference, according to Lorde, "must not be tolerated but seen as a fund of necessary polarities between which our creativity can spark like a dialectic" (Lorde). A disregard for difference preserves the hegemonic systems of power that these social justice movements seek to dismantle. The demonization of difference repurposes what Lorde refers to as "the master's tools” (Lorde). Failing to recognize the complexity and interconnectedness of identity perpetuates systems of white supremacy and patriarchy, neglecting the possibility of coalition building amongst marginalized groups.

To address the shortcomings of the Civil Rights and Women's Liberation Movements, Black feminists center the experiences of Black women as a critical area of knowledge. Exploring these experiences generates a growing consciousness necessary to challenge white supremacy and the patriarchy. The feminists within the Combahee Collective were able to combat their feelings of disillusionment through an awareness of "sexual politics, patriarchal rule, and, most importantly, feminism" (Combahee). This education provides the foundation for the development of new political tools needed to counter cultural imperialism, sexism, and systemic racism (Lorde). Black feminists claim that the political actors within the Civil Rights and feminist movements lack the determination to educate themselves on these topics. According to Lorde, white feminists feel ill-equipped to teach material related to Black feminism and claim that it is unrelated to their curriculum. Hooks elaborates on the problems of white academia, noting that many women's studies programs are primarily filled with white women discussing white women's issues, often from racist perspectives. This ongoing problem perpetuates a dangerous ignorance that further reinforces stereotypes of women of color.

Black feminism goes beyond demanding a single reckoning with the current issues. It calls for an ongoing and relentless effort to unpack mentally ingrained structures of white patriarchal supremacy. Hooks emphasizes the importance of this continuous process, describing it as "a process of becoming" (Hooks). This process requires a profound introspective evaluation of our principles and values, as well as an examination of the ways we uphold the central tenets of hegemonic masculinity (Hooks). According to Hooks, a productive feminist revolution cannot be achieved without a critical analysis of the "charged connections" present between white and Black women (Hooks). A more intersectional approach to feminism is possible through a reexamination of our relationships.

Audre Lorde expands on these ideas by advocating for a mental reprogramming against our "internalized patterns of oppression" (Lorde). Through this examination, we can challenge the ways societal norms and structures have influenced thinking and perpetuated harmful prejudices (Lorde). By challenging these internalized patterns, individuals can actively work towards liberating themselves from oppressive ideologies and assumptions. The advancement of Black feminism necessitates an ongoing commitment to dismantling white supremacy and sexism. It requires continuous self-reflection, challenging our own complicity in oppressive systems, and restructuring our internal frameworks to foster liberation.

These perspectives provide a useful outline for combating all forms of oppression, as they offer insights that can be applied across various marginalized groups. The internal work advocated by Black feminists has broader implications beyond their specific experiences.

Oppressive systems derive their power from their ability to influence the collective psyche of society. The persistent disillusionment that Black feminists strive to eliminate is a pervasive issue for individuals enduring various forms of marginalization. Hooks underscores this point through her depiction of the American project. She makes clear that the unleashing of capitalist oppression, racial violence, and xenophobic practices required the manipulation of public consciousness (Hooks). This process of brainwashing occurs within both public and private institutions, notably within the American education system. Hooks highlights the role of white women in this example, but the concept of conditioning can be applied to other marginalized groups as well.

It is evident that individuals who experience marginalization in any capacity often find solace in accepting a distorted version of American history as the truth. This skewed narrative perpetuates the idea that assimilation and integration provide a productive path toward alleviating systemic oppressions. Lorde shows that this acceptance of a distorted history reinforces the status quo, sustaining our current oppressive systems. To combat oppression effectively, it is necessary for all marginalized groups to engage in critical self-reflection and challenge the narratives that have been imposed upon them.

The various forms of oppression that Black women endure uniquely position them to offer a valuable framework for deconstructing hegemonic powers. As highlighted by the Combahee Collective, Black women, particularly those who do not conform to heteronormative standards, lack the privileges associated with class, race, and sex. Consequently, they have the fewest resources available to confront the most pervasive forms of oppression (Combahee). Despite these immense challenges, Black women's uphill battle serves as a transformative testament of perseverance, creativity, and love, inspiring other marginalized groups to follow suit.

Placed at the bottom of the social ladder, Black women gain a comprehensive view of other areas of oppression. Their marginalized position offers them a unique perspective that encompasses a wide range of struggles experienced by various communities. By intimately understanding the interconnected nature of oppressions, Black women are equipped with a profound awareness that can inform strategies for dismantling systemic injustices. A victory for Black feminism is a victory for all, for the socio-political emancipation of Black women “would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression” (Combahee). By embracing this perspective and learning from the resilience of Black women, marginalized communities can forge a path towards liberation and foster the solidarity needed for abolition.

The critical analysis offered by the Combahee River Collective, Audre Lorde, and Bell Hooks regarding the Civil Rights and Women's Liberation Movements symbolize the importance of the Black feminist tradition. Their critiques offer an alluring perspective of self-determination, advocating for an escape from mental slavery towards a radical conscience. The changes seek to employ draw connections between various systems of oppression to produce a boundless journey towards equity.
