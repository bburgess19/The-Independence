Eastern Congo, despite being a tumultuous amalgam of infighting among various militant groups vying for influence and control of the region since the turn of the century, had in the past decade before the pandemic been making laudable progress in reconciliation and nation-building efforts. The UN [peacekeeping](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-peacekeepers-begin-withdrawal-eastern-congo-2024-02-29/) force that had been deployed in 2010 to quell rising tensions was getting ready to be recalled, in part due to calming tensions, but also due to an inability to effectively protect citizens against the various militias. However, in late 2021, North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces were rocked by a resurgence of M23 rebels. They indiscriminately massacred civilians, leaving a trail of broken communities, and unleashing a [humanitarian](https://apnews.com/article/un-congo-humanitarian-sexual-violence-conflict-minerals-0f5ebeaccff39ab97c61e981f1a7a3cf) crisis that has left over 8 million in need of assistance, as well as subjected countless women to mass-scale sexual violence. Despite the alarming displacement of communities and the sexual atrocities perpetrated against the Congolese, the U.N has received a meager [third](https://apnews.com/article/un-congo-humanitarian-sexual-violence-conflict-minerals-0f5ebeaccff39ab97c61e981f1a7a3cf) of the $2.3 billion dollars needed to address the humanitarian crisis, forcing aid workers into the impossible dilemma of deciding who and what to prioritize.

The renewed conflict is one steeped in a dark history of ethnic conflict, internecine and vengeful assaults, and the complex geopolitics of a gatekeeper nation as equally rich with minerals as it is with well-armed opposition groups. To contextualize the current situation in Eastern Congo, it is necessary to understand in brief the key players and their motivations. Dating back to the [1994 Rwandan Genocide](https://theconversation.com/rwanda-and-drcs-turbulent-past-continues-to-fuel-their-torrid-relationship-188405), many Hutu perpetrators belonging to the Interharamwe (the main paramilitary unit that spearheaded the genocide) fled into the DRC (then Zaire), where years later they formed the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). The faction’s raison d'etre remained the extirpation of ethnic Tutsis. Thus, Rwanda launched military operations against the group, a move that saw the deposition of DRC’s president Mobutu Sese-Seko in the First Congo War (1996-1997). Between the end of the 20th Century and 2009, Rwanda accused the Congolese government of aiding the FDLR, while the DRC accused Rwanda of supporting Tutsi paramilitary groups in the eastern portion of the nation. One of these groups was [M23](https://www.reuters.com/article/congo-democratic-fighting-idUSL5E8MI3WX20121118/), a largely Tutsi group that formed in 2012 in retaliation to the DRC’s purported [failure](https://theatlasnews.co/conflict/2024/01/05/understanding-africa-the-history-of-the-drcs-m23-rebels/) to integrate former members of a militia unit-turned political party into the Congolese military. The group broke away, set up base in North Kivu province after being hounded relentlessly by the Congolese military, and has been involved in skirmishes against the military since then. Both Uganda and Rwanda have been [accused](https://theatlasnews.co/conflict/2024/01/05/understanding-africa-the-history-of-the-drcs-m23-rebels/) of financing and arming the M23 rebels, with Rwanda going as far as providing military intelligence and personnel.

Just as signs of rapprochement between Kinshasa and Kigali were beginning to manifest, M23 [renewed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/04/m23-rebel-group-congo-rwanda-uganda/) its attacks in mid-late 2022. Since then, the resulting displacement of people has been [historic](https://apnews.com/article/congo-humanitarian-crisis-displaced-killed-msf-7f7057a4c6473d1027cca2a60d59515c), both in scale and duration. While the group alleges to exist as a means to keep the DRC’s government accountable, speculations of cobalt control have been rumored to be the vehicle through which the group seeks to secure its power and reach. Controlling the mineral rich eastern portion of the nation is a lucrative venture, especially since large troves of cobalt reserves – a mineral requisite for electric car batteries manufacturing – and diamonds are mined in the region. With more than [two thirds](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/world/china-congo-cobalt.html) of the world’s cobalt production originating from Congo, Western and Chinese-backed corporations have descended into the region with insatiable appetite, each eager to carve out a piece of the mining rights with neither the slightest regard for the environmental carnage wrought about, nor the displaced communities evicted by the roar of voracious, cobalt-hungry machines. Regional control by the militias would ensure access to loyalties and revenue from the extraction and passage of mined cobalt, a possibility that is sure to exacerbate the violence and displacement.

When elephants clash, it is the grass that suffers, an adage the innocent Congolese civilians trapped between state geopolitics and resources wars are painfully aware of. Amidst depleting aid reserves punctuated by an ever-growing trail of tears are calls by international organizations and displaced communities for aid and intervention, which have thus far been met by [empty](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/why-aid-groups-are-warning-of-a-new-humanitarian-crisis-in-eastern-congo) platitudes by major world governments. Sadly, the combination of American and Chinese corporations deeply entrenched in cobalt extraction, the war in Gaza, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have somehow relegated conversations and aid regarding the staggering human loss in the DRC to the margins. It is a reality painfully reminiscent of the [2021 humanitarian crisis](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1102632) in the same region, where despite the unprecedented number of internally displaced individuals, the repeated epidemics of cholera, malaria, and measles, and the staggering levels of food insecurity, the plight of the Congolese once more faded to the background as the pandemic and the raging war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region dominated global headlines.
