Between the primary and secondary art markets, the general representations of what African art is exist at near opposite ends of the spectrum. The primary market involves the selling and buying of work that has never been sold and, more importantly, valued before. This is the artwork that comes straight from the artist’s studio and into the hands of dealers, collectors, galleries, and art fairs. This becomes the milieu of contemporary art we see today. The secondary market, in contrast to the primary market, involves the re-selling of work that has already been evaluated. This is the kind of work seen in museums and the collections of collectors. At the mercy of tastes and trends, it is not surprising that what became emblematic of African art is different. Within museums, the more public institutions compared to galleries and art fairs, African art is rooted in history and the past. Ceremonial and utilitarian masks, clothing, sculptures, and objects are tied to locations and tribes rather than a single artist. Whereas, within the contemporary art market, identity and the creation of it is important. Each work is attributed to a single artist, their practice, and the life experiences that have contributed to it. The membrane that exists between the two markets has only been permeable for contemporary African artists for the past few years with introductions of artists such as ABOUDIA, the Ivorian-born and Brooklyn-based mixed-media painter, and Julie Mehretu, the American-Ethiopian large-scale abstractionist, into the auction and museum worlds. For others who have yet to garner the same following and attention, galleries and the accompanying art fairs are their only means of exposure to the wider art market.

## Salah Elmur

An admittedly selfish first choice, Salah Elmur (or El Mur, depending on who you ask) is a Sudanese painter, graphic designer, author, and filmmaker living and working in Cairo. The first time I saw his work was at the Chicago EXPO, presented as a part of Cape Town-based gallery, Martin Projects. Elmur’s work is imbued with a sense of nostalgia as he captures aspects of Sudanese life in his paintings with a surrealist flair, defying rules of proportion and arrangement. The Chicago EXPO which is a ticketed, open to the public event hosted every year in Chicgao’s Navy Pier, is an excellent way of being exposed to a variety of galleries, museums, art collectives in Chicago, and more. Elmur has been collected at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden in Marrakesh, and the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town.

## Abdoulaye Konaté

Abdoulaye Konaté is a Malian artist primarily known for his work with traditional Malian textiles, creating colorful installations that comment on the traditions of West African craftsmanship. Though I was familiar with him because of my own personal studies at the Univeristy, the first time I got to see his work in person was at the 1-54 art festival held in Marrakesh. It was only in person that I could realize the scale of his work. The use of cloth in his practices bridges the divide between the contemporary and the historical while its volumes allow him to broach the realm of abstraction. His work features commentary about the economic, social, and political problems in Africa. The 1-54 is an art festival held around the world in Marrakesh, New York, and London with the dedicated aim of heightening the visibility of Contemporary African art. His work has been collected by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

## Fathi Hassan

Another 1-54 discovery, Fathi Hassan is an Egyptian-born, Scotland-based artist whose work primarily incorporates Arabic script into his installations. Of Nubian and Egyptian descent, his work is altogether familiar and a reimagining of concepts of forced migration and the loss incurred with colonial domination. The script featured in his works on paper, photographs, or drawings reflects the consequences of cultural dominiation in its illegibility. Taking on different forms, the script takes the shape of flowers, animals, human faces, and more, affording the work a symbolic and literal meaning. His work has been collected by the Victoria and Albert Msuuem and the British Museum in London, the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art in Washington D.C., and the Farjam Collections.

## Hako Hankson

Born in Western Cameroon, Hako Hankson, whose real name is Gaston Hako, is a painter whose work recasts the myths of African civilizations. Providing ancient histories a contemporary resonance, Hankson’s work is a method of storytelling that brings otherwise underrepresented themes of African dance, theater, and rites into the conversation. Inspired by his father who was a traditional sculptor and dignitary, Hanson was raised with the understanding of the importance of ceremonial objects in practices. In 2015, he founded the IN and OFF Art Center in Douala, Cameroon, a location for artists of all experience levels and his workshop.

## Joana Choumali

Part of the running trend of artists whose work I have been lucky to see first-hand, Abidjan-based artist Joana Choumali’s work was also featured in the 1-54 Art Festival. A freelance photographer, Choumali’s recent work explores the diversity of African cultures and diversity through the combination of her photography with religious imagery through the use of mixed media that combines practices of embroidery with her photography. Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Civilizations and Palais de la Culture in AbidiAbidjaning the Photoquai Biennale at the Musee Quai de Branly in Paris, and the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art in Capetown.

## Zizipho Poswa

Cape Town-based ceramicist, Zizipho Poswa is renowned for her hand-coiled, large-scale works. Bold declarations of African womanhood, the sculptures are allusions to the Xhosa culture she grew up around. Currently featured in The Metropolitan Museum’s Before Yesterday We Could Fly: An Afrofuturist Period Room, Poswa’s work has garnered recognition for its moving references to the cultural practices surrounding Xhosa women such as lobola (bride-wealth) and the hairstyles of Black women in Africa and across the diaspora. Her work has been collected by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, THe LOEWE Foundation, and several private collections around the world.

## Prince Gyasi

Living and working in Ghana, Prince Gyasi produces beautifully vivid photographs depicting the realities of his home country. Part of a wave of younger artists, Gyasi has made a name for himself on social media through Instagram and Twitter, using it as a means for showcasing his photographs. The unique thing about Gyasi’s work is that he takes his photographs on an iPhone, placing his work within an accessible context while the use of deeply stylized digital manipulation ensures his artwork is inherently unique to his practice.

## Hyacinthe Ouattara

Multidisciplinary in practice, Burkinabe artist Hyacinthe Ouattara uses color, material, and texture to situate the feelings of his work. His work with textiles has roots in anatomical references whereas his work with plastic touches on themes of balance, memory, representation, and intimacy. Overall, his work is incredibly gestural, guided by spontaneity and the pursuit of sensation. His work has been exhibited worldwide and was included in the 2022 Dakar and Kinshasa Biennales.

## Wangechi Mutu

Kenyan-born visual artist, Wangechi Mutu is known for her painting, sculpture, film, and performance work. Now based in New York, Mutu’s work features commentary on race, gender, identity, and art history. In subject matter her works seem to broach the realm of Afrofuturism featuring alien-like figures and distorted faces, tackling topics of the history of those of African descent and how it can be reimagined. Her work was exhibited at the 2019 Whitney Biennale in New York, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and the New Museum in New York.

The reality is, that finding contemporary African art requires a little effort, albeit one that has become much easier in recent years with digital publications such as Hyperallergic and ArtNet, art fairs dedicated to contemporary African Artists like the 1-54, and social media. Odds are you won’t get to be in the same room as some of the artists you admire for a little while—one of the downsides of the contemporary art world—but when that does happen, it’s a happy coincidence.
