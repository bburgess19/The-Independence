Mycology, or the study of fungi known commonly as mushrooms, is budding into an expansive field of research within the realm of biology. With around 90,000 species discovered and more than 1 million estimated in the world, it is clear that the fungi kingdom is one of the most important in the tree of life. Africa is no exception for the rich biodiversity of fungi present in the world. Although many species remain undiscovered, there is much potential in harnessing fungi for medicinal, agricultural, and architectural purposes.

Africa has become a crucial site to investigate the medicinal applications of fungi. Currently, about 47.6 million Africans suffer from fungal diseases, and this statistic may be severely underreported as the data is collected from 15 out of the 54 African countries. Even more alarming is that South Africa is the only country that has a national mycology research facility on the continent. This gap in surveillance and research has inspired action to bridge the gap in knowledge and establish a Pan-African Mycology Working Group.

Even though resources for surveillance and treatment of fungal pathogens may be lacking, there is a promising line of research into wood-decaying fungi from Southern Ghana in drug discovery to treat drug-resistant microbes. Microbes such as _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _Escherichia coli_, and\_ _Staphylococcus aureus_ have been increasingly drug-resistant, and public health experts are pushing to find novel forms of treatment against these microbes.

According to Aboagye et al., wood-decaying fungi cultures have promising antimicrobial properties to combat against these pathogens. Even more promising is that researchers have postulated that the great biodiversity of wood-decaying fungi in Ghana present many potential sources for drug discovery against these pathogens.

On the other hand, many wild species of fungi in Africa that are edible are also widely unknown and underutilized across the continent. These edible fungi not only add to the biodiversity in Africa, but they can also provide agricultural resources for human nutrition. Authors Sileshi et al. have worked extensively to collect a wide scope of literature and indigenous knowledge to provide an extensive review of the many nutritional properties fungi can provide.

Unfortunately, Sileshi et al. have also cited that activities such as deforestation, loss of habitat, and loss of indigenous knowledge would severely limit the dietary and market opportunities fungi can provide. They have recommended that national forest registries and international frameworks such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) invest in conservation efforts to protect biodiversity and the welfare of local communities.

Cultural awareness and engagement with indigenous communities has also been cited as a focus for understanding not only the physical benefits of fungi but spiritual ones as well. In some communities in the Rakai district of Uganda, fungi have had a presence for traditional ceremonies. Other communities in Cameroon have also been documented to utilize fungi to ward off evil spirits. This indigenous knowledge can serve as a mechanism through which the gaps within scientific knowledge can be closed.

Amazingly, mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus, can play an environmentally friendly and sustainable role within the building of various materials. Notably, mycelium has been cited as a promising resource acting as a glue to cement with other substrates like ground wood, straw, and saw dust among others. This combination of mycelium and substrate can be utilized to form bricks, insulating panels, furniture, and fabrics to name a few examples.

Publications from Green Building Africa detail that mycelium-based materials resemble similar properties like that of expanded polystyrene, commonly known as Styrofoam, but with a much improved level of biodegradability. Above all, fungi can be an amazing and sustainable resource that offer many innovations that donâ€™t necessarily require new technologies or complex materials.

Although research into mycology offers a plethora of exciting innovations, a clear common thread throughout all of this research is that more funding and experimentation is crucial to scratch more than just the surface. Africa, with its biodiversity of many fungi, can become a great hub for the innovative potential of mycology to improve many communities.
