On July 26th Nigeriens found themselves in a tumultuous political landscape that threatened to unravel growing hopes of the first stable democratic transition of power in the nation’s history as a new military order took form. Conducted over [allegations](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/burkina-faso-and-mali-warn-against-foreign-intervention-after-niger-coup) of poor governance and improper handling of security threats linked to al-Qaeda and ISIS, the military takeover led by the Presidential Guard saw the detainment of President Mohamed Bazoum, the suspension of the constitution and most national institutions, the closure of all borders and airspaces, and an institution of a ruling junta.

Although the takeover has sent jolts across the region and the globe as Niger potentially connects the belt of military rule stretching across the Sahel (Mauritania to Sudan), analyzing the writing on the wall offers a different story. In a chilling political pattern of preemptive armament as a means to forestall political demise seen across other [regions](https://www.cfr.org/blog/africas-multiple-security-crises?utm_source=blognotification&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Blog%20Post%20Notification%20Africa%20in%20Transition&utm_term=AfricaInTransition) of Africa, the previous president, President Issoufou, had generously armed the Presidential Guard to thwart any coup attempts, helping to nurture and sustain an environment where military force and takeover was a viable option. President Bazoum, in an effort to withdraw himself from the shadow of his predecessor and establish his own agenda, had [sidelined](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/behind-nigers-coup-feud-over-former-presidents-legacy-2023-08-06/) notable public figures, especially those involved with the oil sectors, and hamstrung the power of significant military commanders by curbing their autonomy and launching anti-corruption programs. This reduction of military power, including those of the Presidential Guard, is speculated to have triggered in part the takeover as a self-preservation maneuver by the military elite.

Regardless, the takeover has triggered regional and international uncertainties. Niger is a crucial bulwark against terrorism and [militant insurgency](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-niger-matters-everything-you-need-to-know-about-west-africa-s-latest-coup/ar-AA1eY7c8) in the Sahel, a role that has seen members of ECOWAS, along with France and the United States, commit considerable military, political, and financial resources to. Its transitioning political atmosphere could signal waning military presence and might, reigniting the emergence and continued operation of jihadist terrorist groups in the region. A lack of vigorous coordinated international action to combat the various extremist groups had already hampered the region prior to the takeover, so this would undoubtedly implicate the Sahel and the surrounding Sub-Saharan nations. Naturally, the potential instability this takeover could result in has generated fissures within [ECOWAS](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/burkina-faso-and-mali-warn-against-foreign-intervention-after-niger-coup) and challenged its internal unity as its members argue over the proper response; amidst threats of military intervention to reinstate President Bazoum by the coalition, some (like Guinea) have vehemently condemned the union and its anti-democratic tendency, while others (like Nigeria) have expressed wavering commitment that has all but castrated any hopes of immediate reistation. Despite this, the bloc has cut off financial ties, while the U.S and the European Union has severely cut the military and financial aid to the nation.

Interestingly, Mali and Burkina Faso have rallied in strong support of the junta, threatening to intervene (militarily if necessary) if any nations attempt to militarily coerce the reinstatement of President Bazoum. Backed by Russia and Wagner Group mercenaries, the two nations similarly experienced their own recent [coups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/08/niger-coup-wagner-islamist-extremism-france-united-states/), and have not shied away from censuring Western, especially French, influence and longstanding political meddling in the region. They have praised Niger’s actions to [distance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/08/niger-coup-wagner-islamist-extremism-france-united-states/) itself from France especially. Given how strong of an ally Niger was to the West in the region, the new junta will most likely seek to [leverage](https://theconversation.com/what-caused-the-coup-in-niger-an-expert-outlines-three-driving-factors-210721) its role in promoting regional stability and security to force its acceptance.

As always, following the money trail unravels a deeper concern beyond democratic integrity, constitutional order, and regional stability; uranium, gold, and oil. Niger, with its uranium-rich mines, is the [7th](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/uranium-mines-niger-worlds-7th-biggest-producer-2023-07-28/) largest producer of the mineral, which is critical for nuclear energy, naval propulsion, cancer treatment technologies, etc. A French multinational corporation not only owns one of the major mines in Niger, but France sources roughly [15%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-niger-matters-everything-you-need-to-know-about-west-africa-s-latest-coup/ar-AA1eY7c8) of its uranium needs from the nation, while Europe depends on roughly 30%. Different reports suggest that the junta has halted gold and uranium exports to its former colonizer. Equally debilitating to Western Europe is the oil pipeline that was scheduled to pump natural gas from Nigeria. With a $13b price tag, the 5,600 kilometer-long [Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Coup-In-Niger-Could-Derail-This-Strategic-Pipeline.html) snakes from Nigeria through Niger and Algeria before reaching existing pipelines in Europe, and was expected to alleviate Europe’s energy demands especially in the wake of the Nord Stream’s closure. This resource factor and France’s waning influence in the region reflects a shifting dynamic in the global order as more and more African nations resist the patronizing attitude of Western diplomatic relations, re-engage deeper with the economic ties that extend from colonial eras, and reformulate their role within the global order beyond mere suppliers of raw materials and consumers of Western pity.

The events unfolding in Niger are far from their satisfactory if not acceptable conclusion, and the junta’s diplomatic maneuvering of ECOWAS and the West’s demands versus Russia’s growing influence will define its trajectory. Inaction and stagnation could have deleterious consequences financially, economically, and militarily, making the leverage currently held by the junta precariously fragile.
