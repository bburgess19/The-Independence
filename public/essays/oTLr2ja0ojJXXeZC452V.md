**Executive Summary**

West Africa has been plagued by an extremely large illegal wildlife trafficking (IWT) market since 2015. In recent years, West and Central Africa have become a major source of the trafficking of elephant ivory and pangolin scales to other parts of the world. As this problem has grown, so too has the recognition that IWT in West Africa is not limited to individual poachers and has strong links to powerful transnational organized crime groups (TOCs).

While certain measures have been undertaken to address this issue, such as the establishment of the West Africa Strategy on Combating Wildlife Crime (WASCWC), the flow of money in wildlife trafficking has not been adequately investigated and engaged by West African states. Individual countries have succeeded in catching and punishing poachers in parks and wildlife, but overall, there has been a failure to have a concerted effort to minimize the illicit trade throughout the region.

How can these states take a more proactive approach? The Royal United Service Institute (RUSI) survey found that only 25% (three countries) of those surveyed had “conducted a financial investigation in an IWT case.”<sup>[1]</sup> Instead of turning to wildlife protectors to seek out poachers, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) needs to investigate the flow of money that is involved in illegal wildlife trafficking. The West African Network to Combat Wildlife Crime (WAN) is a step towards addressing this but needs to be solidified as an institutional mechanism to achieve the goals desired.

This policy brief addresses what ECOWAS can do to combat wildlife trafficking. Given that the actors involved in wildlife trafficking in West Africa are often closely tied to Central Africa, and that this problem is inherently transnational, this brief makes reference to criminal activity in both regions.

To that end, the policy suggestions below are threefold. First, the WAN must increase its legal capacity forcing states to implement their policy suggestions. Second, the WAN should gain access to government transactions and permits to avoid corruption. Finally, the WAN should increase regulatory and financial cooperation with its Asian counterparts, especially China, to mitigate demand.

**West and Central Africa: The home of Illegal Wildlife Trafficking**

West Africa demonstrates three main drivers of wildlife trafficking. The first, freedom of movement. ECOWAS, like the European Union, is a free trade, freedom of movement area. As a result, there is limited policing on the trade moving in between these countries, some of which contain goods such as ivory and pangolin scales.

Second, there are high levels of corruption and political instability in the region. Combating wildlife crime is simply not a priority with the many issues taking precedence in ECOWAS policy.

Primarily, with five members of ECOWAS having successful coups in the past four years, and the destruction of democratic institutions, TOCs have managed to flourish and take advantage of the uncertainty in the region. Further, ECOWAS’ governments are focused on solidifying the democratic processes in the region, giving TOCs the opportunity to expand their IWT institutions.

Finally, there are global supply shortages of illegal wildlife products. With China and Southeast Asia cracking down on wildlife trafficking, there has been a large increase in demand for the goods that Africans can supply. As such, the industry is seen as profit-generating and attractive to TOCs looking to expand or diversify. The increase in demand for wildlife, especially endangered species has caused the diversification to be more and more likely for criminal groups. Abotsi et al find that “wildlife crime is now increasingly dominated by emerging criminal networks that specialize in wildlife poaching and trafficking, as well as established organized crime groups that are expanding into this lucrative market.”<sup>[2]</sup>

Illegal wildlife trafficking in the region is mostly made up of elephant ivory and pangolin scales. RUSI found that “93% of forest elephant ivory seized internationally between 2006 and 2014 came from the Tri-National Dja-Odzala-Minkébé (TRIDOM).”<sup>[3]</sup> This area encapsulates regions in Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, and the Central African Republic (CAR). This figure does not even include the amounts coming from other high-source countries like Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. While most of this region is in Central Africa, RUSI also identifies that for Pangolin scales, “54.8% of the total weight of seizures linked to Africa between 2016 and 2019 originated, transited or were destined for Nigeria.”<sup>[4] </sup>As such, West and Central Africa act interchangeably as massive sources and consumers of illegal wildlife trafficking.

The problem goes beyond wildlife trafficking because of the heavy involvement of TOCs. While one Irish and two Spanish wildlife experts were filming in Burkina Faso to bring attention to the high levels of IWT, an extremist group known as “Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin” attacked their armed convoy in a national park bordering Benin.”<sup>[5]</sup> Wildlife trafficking is so crucial to these TOCs that they will attack foreign citizens who are simply trying to raise awareness on the issue. Any harm to their trafficking funding is a harm to their organization. This highlights the effect that governmental action and transnational coordination on IWT can have on TOCs who are dependent on this as a source of funding for their activities in the region.

While the Environmental Investigation Agency criticized many countries in West and Central Africa for their “low levels of resilience in their response to organized crime,” there is also a danger of the consequences for local populations if action against IWT is taken.<sup>[6] </sup>The RUSI report highlights that while “the ultimate beneficiaries may be organized crime networks, the poaching economy plays a significant role in the livelihoods of rural people too.”<sup>[7] </sup>Some local actors may be resistant to policies that criminalize or hinder their ability to earn income via poaching. As such, policy implementation on IWT comes with this potential and undesired side effect. Therefore, while the policy must seek to eradicate all forms of illegal wildlife trafficking, a focus on the financial flow of the illegal trafficking can help in harming TOCs, rather than merely targeting individual poachers.

Beyond individual poachers, the IWT also supports entire communities. In a survey on wildlife trade in Ghana, it was estimated that “up to 92% of all wildlife species traded in various markets in Ghana are supplied by middlemen who purchase the products from poachers directly in hunting communities across the country.”<sup>[8]</sup> Despite not being amongst the countries in Africa with the highest levels of poaching, a lot of the foods that Ghanaians consume, purchased from markets, is derived from poaching. There is a lackadaisical culture towards animal and wildlife conservation in the country, and in West African nations as a whole, with many officials claiming there are more important things to work on. However, with the effects of poaching on the environment, these governments ought to pay more attention to the devastation to their wildlife and nature that poaching, logging, and the like causes.

The crisis is bolstered by the ties that many governments have to this form of IWT. For example, in the Gambia, “illegal rosewood exports are worth an estimated 10% of [their] GDP, or up to half of its total exports, with the government benefiting from this trade.”<sup>[9]</sup> This raises the question: how can we expect nations to fight illicit trafficking if many are benefitting from it alongside these TOC networks? This emphasizes the need for ECOWAS to act in unison, as individual countries fighting IWT might not generate the results desired due to their connections to the industry. If one country is left out from the fight, the market will simply roll on to other African countries and the cyclical problem will reemerge once again.

**WASCWC and current policy proposals**

The current policy approach varies from country to country. Many countries, especially the francophone West, Central, and South African countries participate in symposiums with the United Nations to discuss the root causes of their IWT issues.<sup>[10]</sup> Nevertheless, advice is not enough. The tendency of governments from these nations to listen but not act, especially in a setting with limited enforcement, is testament to the lack of regulation on wildlife activity.

While these discussions are useful, it involves a set of wildlife experts from Europe and North America advising African government officials on actions they need to take. There are multiple issues with this image. First, African experts need to connect with African government officials, as they possess the cultural ties and knowledge to inform policy implementation in a much brighter light than others. Second, UN experts must confer with African experts and provide strategies for educating and raising awareness (for both governments and the public) that have worked in their experience. There is no guarantee that their experience will translate, but it acts as a stepping stone for African experts. Finally, as this policy brief will outline, legal binding is crucial for enforcement.

Prior to the ratification of WASCWC by ECOWAS in 2023, individual states focused on providing increased law enforcement to natural reserves and wildlife parks. They have done this by using sniffer dogs to catch wildlife criminals and increasing the presence of wildlife administrators to work alongside police forces.<sup>[11]</sup> By doing this, governments were able to display achievements of individual poachers being captured and punished. As outlined above, however, this attacked part of the problem without attacking the source. This is not to say that law enforcement in these areas is destructive, as it helped deter poachers from certain areas and decreased the frequency of poaching. Nevertheless, because of the role that TOCs play in wildlife trafficking, there is a requirement to focus on their means and processes as opposed to individual poachers.

The WASCWC was a tremendous step forward. This strategy sought to increase collaboration amongst states, improve research and monitoring of wildlife crime, and ensure international regulatory cooperation on legal processes for wildlife crime.<sup>[12]</sup> As this strategy was only ratified in 2023,<sup>[13]</sup> it is too early to evaluate its results and the strength of its implementation. Nevertheless, the WASCWC failed to account for one key issue that all signatories face: corruption. The WAN, the institutional mechanism through which the WASCWC will be implemented, has virtually no power and leaves the room open for individual states (like those that profit from it) to be less responsive to policy suggestions.

**The West African Network: Where to go from here**

The WAN must take three factors into consideration alongside its current mandate. First, the WAN must have legal capacity. The community court of Justice (CCJ), the legal body of ECOWAS, should adjudicate concerns brought forward by WAN.<sup>[14]</sup> In the current framework, WAN reports concerns to individual governments who are then expected to act on it. As discussed above, how can we expect Gambia to follow WAN protocol when their export economy is strongly tied to IWT? The CCJ must act on behalf of WAN, much like it does with all terms of the ECOWAS agreement, to ensure that IWT is addressed in the way that the WAN suggests. In this sense, countries are bound to international cooperation by law, not by their word, and are forced into adhering to the policies and requirements set forth by the WAN.

Second, the WAN must have access to government transactions and permits. This helps address corruption as a driver of wildlife trafficking. A 2019 report by EIA found that “corrupt officials falsely issued ‘salvage permits’ that allowed companies to continue widespread logging despite the bans.”<sup>[15]</sup> By targeting permits, the WAN can address one of three concerns in West African IWT: corruption. If government officials are required to demonstrate that permits are being issued in accordance with WAN policies, and the laws of ECOWAS in general, it makes corrupt activity far less attractive to officials in fear of government sanctions. In addition, access to government transactions allows them to highlight any potential unordinary flows of money into government accounts and track their trajectory. Though this policy would be considered dangerous for sovereign governments in fear of releasing private information, transparency is the only means through which the corruption involved in IWT (and beyond) can be addressed.

Third, the WAN must seek assistance from East and Southeast Asian countries, primarily China. This helps to address the supply shortages as a driver of wildlife trafficking. West African countries are exporting here “to meet the demands of the Asian market.”<sup>[16]</sup> While the onus is on West and Central Africa to limit the flow of IWT, support from Asian counterparts would help this goal. WAN should seek to coordinate with Asian port countries to increase inspection of potential wildlife shipments and request financial contribution to WAN’s activities. Beyond this, institutionalizing financial and regulatory cooperation between West African governments and East Asian governments is crucial in attacking the demand side of the IWT issue. The financial strength of an institution is directly correlated to a higher likelihood of success, and with increased funding, the WAN can expand their activities to target both the money flow of IWT and poaching/illegal logging on the ground.

**Concluding Remarks**

The steps have been taken towards addressing the high levels of IWT occurring in West and Central Africa, but execution is crucial. If the WAN has the legal power, transparency, and international aid it requires, it will be a powerful tool for addressing the root of IWT in the region. If the WAN begins to assume the role of a bureaucratic failure, there will be little faith in the only long-term solution that all states have agreed to. WAN is the first step towards a more powerful anti-corruption transnational organization, capable of heavily weakening TOCs in the region.
