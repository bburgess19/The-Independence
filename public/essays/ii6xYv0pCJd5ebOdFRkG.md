<blockquote>"حريه، سلام، وعداله. مدنية خيار الشعب."</blockquote>

For months, hundreds of Sudanese civilians have been traumatized, targetted, and terrorized in the violent crossfire of intense fighting which erupted between military and paramilitary forces on April 15th. That was the 24th day of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a very sacred time of spiritual dedication by way of fasting, reflection, and community for many Sudanese. A week later, millions of Muslims across the globe marked Ramadan’s completion with a celebration of Eid al-Adha. In Sudan, tragically, the spirit of festivity was corroded by shots of gunfire and clouds of smoke in the wake of what’s been called ‘a civil war’ under the terms of international law.

Armed conflicted, egregious destruction, and indiscriminate violence has since uprooted the lives of millions more in the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed “Hemedti” Hamdan Dagalo. Both factions are strongly reminiscent of the pervasively corrupt Bashir regime, whose leader civilians successfully toppled in 2019 in a relentless revolutionary endeavor to realize a Sudanese civilian-led democracy. The paramilitary RSF—an evolved form of ‘the Janjaweed’—is widely known for the human rights violations it committed in the Darfur region during the 2000s, which displaced approximately 2.5 million people and claimed the lives of some 300,000.

**_Why are the SAF and the RSF fighting?_**

Although civil demonstrations succeeded in overthrowing al-Bashir in 2019, remnants of his corrupt regime persisted as military forces insisted in retaining control of the state. However, civilians were unwavering in their calls for “حريه، سلام، وعداله. مدنية خيار الشعب” — while the power of the revolutionary slogan is diluted in translation, it translates roughly to “Freedom, peace, and justice. Democracy is the choice of the people.”

Although the ousting of al-Bashir was a massive revolutionary success, it came at the expense of countless innocent lives. The military junta resorted to violent “dispersals” of the protests (i.e., killing peaceful protestors at random). At this point, the RSF and the SAF were working together to resist revolution and quell civil unrest. In order to conceal its own atrocities, the state also implemented drastic and widespread limitations on telecommunication/internet access in Sudan. The government’s response to civil demonstrations resulted in countless injuries and hundreds of deaths, although the actual statistics are skewed by state tactics to evade accountability (e.g., tying boulders to the bodies of massacred protesters and dumping them in the Nile River).

The result of these tensions between the revolutionary demand for civilian-led democracy and the military’s refusal to relinquish its control of the state was a compromise in the form of an agreement which created the Transitional Military Council (TMC). The TMC was a joint civilian and military council arranged to lead the country’s transition to democracy for three years, until elections which were planned to take place in 2022.

Although some saw it as a step in the right direction, the TMC disappointed the demand for civilian-led democracy by enabling the military junta to solidify its control and legitimize its rule in a coup amidst political infighting and deadlock which constantly delayed the promise of democratic elections. In spite of popular resistance to the military, Sudan’s transition to democracy is being derailed by a competition for state control, primarily between Hemedti’s RSF and Burhan’s SAF.

**_What makes the conflict in Sudan a ‘civil war’? — Global complicity and Western culpability for conflict in Sudan_**

In spite of the resilience of Sudanese revolutionaries, tension between military and paramilitary forces ultimately erupted into a full-fledged war, specifically due to the RSF’s resistance to integration with the SAF. After the RSF launched uncoordinated redeployments and attempted to seize state control in another coup, clashes ensued as the SAF struggled to suppress their opposition and secure strategic territory (including important locations like the presidential palace and Khartoum International Airport).

This ongoing violent conflict has had devastating consequences for the Sudanese population, as neither fighting force respects or regards civilian life in their fight for power—to call it a ‘civil’ war would implicate countless innocent civilians who were injured, sexually assaulted, displaced, bombarded, robbed, or killed deliberately or indiscriminately at the hands of a merciless and divided military junta.

Even a cursory examination of Sudan’s war begs for a thorough reassessment of international law generally, and specifically, of what makes a war a ‘civil’ one. On the whole, the global humanitarian response to the conflict in Sudan has been disheartening, but certainly unsurprising. Amidst fatal shortages of water, food, and medical supplies with insubstantial relief efforts, the RSF and the SAF have agreed to several ceasefires, but devastation continues as each ceasefire proves unsuccessful and civilian casualties continue to escalate.

Ironically, the conflict surrounding the Sudanese state has been provoked largely by the interventions of Western nations. For example, the EU has long legitimized and empowered the military junta with money, arms, and other resources in hopes of ‘curbing’ or ‘controlling’ migration, most recently through the launch of the ‘Khartoum Process’ (the EU-Horn of Africa Migration Route Initiative) in 2014.

Moreover, many of the guns used to kill Sudanese civilians are made by the US—the US provides Saudi Arabia with arms in exchange for oil, while the latter provides the Sudanese military junta with arms in exchange for child soldiers to support their war in Yemen. These exchanges are merely instances of a larger pattern of the West creating conflict in African nations, exploiting political instability, and then suddenly abandoning their saviour complex when the empty promise of ‘universal human rights’ is really put to the test.

Backed by the US and mediated by Saudi Arabia, talks between the RSF and the SAF arranged in the Saudi city of Jeddah began on May 6th but have rendered limited progress, as the rival forces refuse to come to a settlement on a permanent ceasefire. Many revolutionaries have criticized the Jeddah talks as a distraction from a genuine civilian-led democratic transition. With the absence of any civilian voice, they leave the restoration of peace and stability in the hands of the forces most detrimental to it. Furthermore, the Jeddah talks merely create a guise of humanitarian concern while concealing the culpability of Saudi Arabia and the West in their contributions to Sudanese suffering.

As Burhan and the SAF grapple for control of the state, their war continues to destroy the physical and social infrastructure of the nation. Meanwhile, the RSF, which has a verified Twitter account, has been using the platform to publish polished media statements intended to denounce their rival force by categorically denying their own atrocities. On April 30th, the paramilitary force [shared](https://twitter.com/rsfsudan/status/1652650393522823169?s=42) the following statement:

<blockquote>
The RSF emphasizes its commitment to the temporary ceasefire, to open safe corridors, and to facilitate the evacuation of Sudanese and foreign nationals.  
We will also persist in our efforts to respond to attacks by radical elements. 
We underscore that the SAF has failed to abide by the ceasefire under the command of its misguided leadership, which is attempting to orchestrate a coup in Sudan.
</blockquote>

**_How the West evacuated their diplomats and abandoned their own nationals_**

Since April 15th, over 900,000 people have been displaced in a mass exodus triggered by the war. Most have fled to other parts of Sudan, as the fighting has concentrated in the capital city of Khartoum. Approximately 200,000 have fled to neighbouring countries for safety, including Egypt, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia. Amidst closed banks and suspended transportation services with skyrocketing prices, millions of civilians remain stranded still with limited financial and logistical means of escape. Beyond these practical challenges, many people have found themselves unable to react swiftly, paralyzed by the shocking upheaval of their communities, homes, and lives.

Meanwhile, the UN and many foreign nations—including the US, UK, France, Australia, and other Western countries—shut down their embassies, destroyed the passports in their possession (for ‘security purposes’), and evacuated their diplomats promptly. Unmatched in their capacity and clear in their priorities, the West provided minimal and delayed guidance to their own nationals in Sudan while leaving many others forsaken without the necessary documentation for travel.

The discrepancies between the West’s reaction to the war in Ukraine (i.e., its warm reception of Ukrainian refugees through relaxed visa/entry requirements and billions of dollars in aid) and the Western response to the war in Sudan have upset many Africans at large. On May 9th, Sudanese writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied (@yassmin_a) took to social media on May 9th to [voice](https://twitter.com/yassmin_a/status/1655896739079962624?s=42) her dismay:

<blockquote>
I’ve been finding myself frustrated at the difference in visa treatment between Ukrainians who left Ukrainian after the war began and Sudanese who are similarly trying to or have left now. My anger is *not* at the Ukrainians, but at systems who values lives differently based on-?

**_Revolutionary innovation & diasporic mobilization—using the digital world to generate global awareness, action, and aid amidst large-scale devastation and displacement_**

Despite negligible mainstream media coverage and limited means of contact/communication with loved ones abroad, Sudanese revolutionaries and the diaspora have mobilized in incredible ways to promote Sudanese liberation and self-determination. Their use of the digital world to amplify calls for civilian-led democracy and coordinate actions between those on the ground and those abroad has been unparalleled in its innovation.

Many have relied on Twitter and other social media networks to share critical updates, spread documentation of danger and destruction, reunite missing people with their families, return missing passports to their owners, and even guide the displaced to safe routes out of the country (the least grueling of which could take even several days). On April 24th, an unnamed Twitter user (@380rel) [asked](https://twitter.com/380rel/status/1650494880253194242?s=42): “Guys does anyone know what could be done if you come across a grenade in Sudan My family found a grenade inside the house gate that hasn’t gone off yet and they don’t know what to do about it.”

It’s important to acknowledge the innovation of these kinds of civilian-coordinated diasporic digital organizing efforts. However, I hope to celebrate their successes without overly sentimentalizing these contributions: the resourcefulness and resilience of Sudanese revolutionaries has been provoked by a history of struggle and suffering for Sudanese self-determination in the shadows of the global stage — a larger pattern of vulnerability to gross political corruption enabled by Western exploitation and negligence of African countries.

For Siddig Ismail Mohamed Tahir—who lost contact with his family during his struggle to flee the country—social media was consequential to his story’s happy ending. Aware that their father on the ground was actively trying to flee Sudan on his own, Tahir’s family communicated with him consistently from abroad through WhatsApp to ascertain his safety and progress. Starting on April 23rd, his daughters became increasingly disturbed by abrupt, lingering radio silence from their father.

Distressed and limited in their capacity to act from a distance, Tahir’s daughters responded proactively by utilizing social media to share ‘Missing’ posts of their father, including detailed updates of his last-known location and their own contact information. On April 27th, his daughter Sarah (@@sarahsiddig**) [shared](https://twitter.com/sarahsiddig**/status/1651689205318205440?s=42), “My dad is still missing…. I cant stress how difficult this time is for me and my family, but we are hopeful that we will all reunite very soon.”

Thankfully, the posts shared by Tahir’s daughters were successful: they were reposted widely under hashtags related to the crisis in Sudan before Tahir was finally reunited with his family on May 3rd. His daughter Ayaa [posted](https://twitter.com/deeblr/status/1653751697703948294?s=42) on Instagram: “We can’t begin to explain how grateful and thankful we are for the entire Sudanese community on the ground and around the world that supported us during this difficult time.”

In addition to deceased loved ones, the digital world is a forum for many to honor martyrs, including those who lost their lives on the frontlines of the Revolution or in defense of their community. On May 7th, Duaa Tariq (@dudatee), an art curator in Khartoum, [posted](https://twitter.com/dudatee/status/1655121434144825344?s=42) to recognize Muhammad Idris—an engineer who died the day previously due to an electric shock. With a photo of Idris posing casually before massive machinery, Tariq offers a solemn notice of his passing:

<blockquote>
He is one of [the] volunteers from Al-Thawra Youth Initiative in El-Fasher. He was part of the team that worked to restore electricity to the health center in Al-Thawra and the southern hospital.

**_Campus Connections—How you can support Sudan at UChicago!_**

As University of Toronto anthropology professor Nisrin Elamin (@minlayla77) remarked recently in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/minlayla77/status/1654954994024546305?s=42) on May 6th:

<blockquote>
 My timeline is filling up with notices of the missing, injured and dead in Sudan and my heart is breaking. God let this violence end, stop the war, the militarization, the brutality of it all. #Sudan.
</blockquote>

Professor Elamin—who actually visited UChicago on February 27th to give a seminar called “Land, Race and Emirati Empire-making in Central Sudan”— was among those civilians who have been forced to evacuate to Jeddah.

Here on campus, members of the Sudanese diaspora and the African-Caribbean Student Association (ACSA) were instrumental in organizing a Pie-A-Board-Member fundraiser which generated over $1,300 toward the Sudanese American Physicians Association (SAPA) and Sudan NextGen in their humanitarian relief projects to provide emergency assistance on the ground.
