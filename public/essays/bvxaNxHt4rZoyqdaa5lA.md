On October 31st [delegates](https://au-afcfta.org/2023/10/african-ipa-capacity-building-conference/) from the African International Promotion Agencies (IPAs) convened in Ghana to concretize investment regulations for the continent as part of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) implementation. Designed to be conduits for foreign direct investments, the IPAs met to streamline the investment protocols outlined by AfCFTA and formulate a cohesive framework for governing investments across the continent. The conference was incredibly encouraging, as it indicated the active pursuit of the visions of an integrated pan-African economy as per AfCFTA. Formally conceived in 2018, [AfCFTA](https://au-afcfta.org/about/#:~:text=The%20AfCFTA%20is%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest%20free%20trade,a%20combined%20GDP%20of%20approximately%20US%24%203.4%20trillion.) is the largest free trade area encompassing 54 member nations of the African Union, and promising greater continental integration by eliminating trade barriers and boosting intra-Africa trade. A feat decades in the making, the project of facilitating trade and movement in the continent was hailed as a pivotal step in diversifying economic ventures, promoting internal investments, and expanding the economic potential of many African state economies by encouraging domestic manufacturing growth. If implemented as envisioned, the agreement would potentially augment the continent’s net income by 7% in a little over a decade, and lift up to 30 million people from extreme poverty.

The benefits of such a large scale integration are abundantly clear, as economic integration within globalization promises many [benefits](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/economic-integration/): the specialization of economies with comparative advantages, the attraction of investments as a result of regulatory convergence, the reduction of costs and liberalization of competitive labor, the expansion of entrepreneurial potential, and the facilitation of increased political cooperation, to name a few. For Africa of course, this transition has been long overdue, especially given that intra-African trade accounted for [15%](https://unctad.org/press-material/facts-figures-0#:~:text=Intra-African%20trade%2C%20defined%20as%20the%20average%20of%20intra-African,Oceania%20were%2C%20respectively%2C%2047%25%2C%2061%25%2C%2067%25%20and%207%25.) of the total trade in the continent, with this number oscillating between [12-20%](https://www.tralac.org/documents/publications/trade-data-analysis/3982-summary-intra-africa-trade-2019/file.html) in the past decade. It is important to note that such aggregate metrics, which have been cited [ad nauseam](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26418780?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference#references_tab_contents) as indicators of economic stagnation and a lack of diversification, obfuscate the complexity of trade in the continent by overlooking numerous factors. First, most figures tend to focus on commodity-based exports like minerals or oils, which hyperinflate the role larger economies like Nigeria, South Africa, or Angola play in our perception of the continental market, dragging down the share of intraregional trade and overlooking the noteworthy levels in intra regional trade especially among landlocked nations. Second, such statistics fail to capture the nuance of regional trade facilitated by regional economic communities like the East African Community (EAC) or the Economic Community of Western-African States (ECOWAS). Member-nations affiliated with such trade blocs tend to show a higher dependence on the continental market than non-members. Lastly, the network of informal or under-reported international statistics, in part a consequence of the challenges of documenting all cross-border trade, means that potentially [11-40%](https://www.gtreview.com/supplements/gtr-africa-2019/africa-trade-briefing/) of the true trade figures are under-reported. Although the AfCFTA was designed as a means to address the abysmally low volume of intra-continental trade, a closer analysis cautions against the potentially debilitating narrative that such general summary statistics can communicate, as well as encourages the recognition of the laudable economic achievements African states have made in recent years.

Nonetheless, transitioning from this milestone achievement that was AfCFTA to a fully integrated pan-African economy will be an onerous task, one requiring much political coordination, diplomatic endurance, and substantial investments in infrastructure and economic and political agreements to fuel free trade. The very task of coordinating 54 nations with disparate economic models and trade engagements largely oriented away from the continent will continue to be a challenge, as will a host of secondary challenges including: political schisms grounded in populism or nationalism that can threaten the project’s vitality by engendering protectionist tendencies; the overhaul required to manage a cohesive fiscal and monetary policy among so many nations; short-term financial shocks incurred by lowering import tariffs and other trade barriers (customs delays, licenses, quotas); the expansion of adequate transportation infrastructure between countries; and the development of financial platforms to complement a necessarily digital economy. Failure to carefully monitor the distributional impacts of such a transition and provide effective safety nets where most needed could result in internecine backlash against AfCFTA.

The heads of AfCFTA have already begun wrestling with such challenges after a [Guided Trade Initiative](https://au-afcfta.org/2023/10/a-year-of-trading-under-afcfta-a-rwandan-businesswomans-story/) involving Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Tunisia was launched in September 2022 as a pilot program. Briggette Harrington for instance, a Rwandan businesswoman and participant of the initiative, was able to obtain the proper documents to export her coffee beans to Ghana, and in doing so minimized the risks of informal trade while expanding her market. Despite her optimism, she struggled to find a sustainable distribution partner in Ghana to achieve proper market penetration, and had to contend with Ghanaian customs officials who charged her imports due to unfamiliarity with the new AfCFTA tariff documentation. Thankfully, the pilot program is working as intended to expose the gaps in infrastructure, logistics, market information, connectivity, and finance that if addressed early enough, can facilitate the adoption of the agreement at a continental scale.

With 54 nations co-signing and 47 formally ratifying the [agreement](https://au.int/en/treaties/agreement-establishing-african-continental-free-trade-area), this ambitious undertaking will undoubtedly take decades before its true impact is properly seen, longer so to fully appreciate it. Optimistically, numerous sound policies have been outlined by the AU to address most of the potential challenges and outline a path forward; an e-Tariff document containing updated schedules of tariff concessions, a “Rules of Origin” manual governing the determination of the origin status of goods, and an Adjustment Fund to cushion the adjustment shocks of a large-scale integrated trading environment. More concretely, the IPA convention’s success is surely an auspicious sign of the willingness among African leaders to make tangible gains on the agreement. With patience and diligence, this new era of trade in the continent can become a new reality. After all, Timbuktu wasn’t built in a day!
