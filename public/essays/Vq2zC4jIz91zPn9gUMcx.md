Can you tell us a bit about your experiences with TOC on the continent and are there any experiences you would like to share?  
</blockquote>

My first experiences in Africa were as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Mali. After about two and a half years in Mali, I worked in international development in Washington, DC for a bit before moving back to West Africa in 2011 to work as a journalist. After some time living and working in West Africa, my focus turned increasingly to issues of Transnational Organized Crime (TOC), primarily drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, and arms trafficking. TOC-oriented research projects, mostly with an organization called the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime subsequently brought me to various parts of North Africa, East Africa, and the Horn of Africa.

Most people associate TOC with notorious kingpins and groups like the Italian Mafia or drug cartels in Mexico, but organized criminal activity is often much more banal than what one sees on Netflix. That’s why I tend to focus more on illicit economies rather than groups and individuals. The interplay between illicit and licit economies is particularly interesting in Africa, given that the informal economies and gray markets comprise a considerable percentage of economic activity on the continent.

I’m also fascinated by how these illicit economic systems work and their relationship to conflict dynamics. Just as importantly, I like examining how the international and national policy responses that target criminal economies and criminal actors often prove counterproductive. That is part of why I have spent so much time looking into the impact of African and European attempts to limit irregular migration by targeting migrant smugglers. In my opinion, these policies have been a disaster, placing migrants at greater risk while at the same time eroding the rights of asylum seekers. The cost to human lives is something that warrants far more attention than it receives, yet tens of thousands of people dying trying to reach safety and opportunity has somehow become normalized.

Various countries in Africa are struggling with the public health challenges that arise from increased drug consumption and abuse. From your experience, what are the challenges that governments face in dealing with this issue? 
</blockquote>

Every country in Africa has their unique socio-political realities, so we can’t paint with too broad a brush here, but I think the common challenge for many African governments is how to engage this issue without doing more harm than good. This might sound like a low bar, but plenty of countries have spent decades making the situation worse through bad policy, the United States being a prime example. I am deeply concerned that militarized approaches to combating drug trafficking in Africa will have the same negative consequences we have seen in North America, Latin America, and Europe.

African governments are generally pursuing prohibitionist approaches to recreational drug use, combined with harsh penalties for drug trafficking. In doing so, they are emphasizing criminal justice and law enforcement approaches to the issue. It certainly makes sense for states to invest in improving their capacity to interdict drug shipments and carry out investigations on drug trafficking networks, but for me, the priority should always be harm reduction.

Even in cases where there is wide agreement that drug use and abuse should be treated as public health issues, there are still so many implementation challenges. Many of the states we are talking about have weak public health systems, so in addition to reinforcing public health budgets, there is also the challenge of building and sustaining new systems.

As with much of the world, there are also strong social stigmas against drug users, which further complicates how African governments can respond. In contexts where drug use is considered deviant behavior and worthy of shame, people are less likely to seek help, and communities are less likely to devote resources to programs that help those struggling with addiction.

While international discourses around drug use tend to focus on illicit substances such as cannabis, heroin, and cocaine, several African states are witnessing a rapid increase in abuse of pharmaceuticals, such as opioids, benzodiazepines, and various types of painkillers. This is a trend that warrants much more attention in policy-making circles, especially as Africa is becoming a “frontier market” for highly addictive pharmaceuticals.

<blockquote>
Over 70% of drugs are imported to Africa. What are the WHO doing to alleviate this and what should they be doing better? Do you think WIPO plays a role in the patenting of drugs? Do powerful countries producing these drugs have a responsibility to provide them for lower costs or even for free with the profits generated from the drugs?
</blockquote>

As you note in your question, there is an inherent tension between the interests of patent holders and the public health imperative to expand the use and production of generics. Organizations like the World Health Organization have long promoted expanding production of generic medicines in Africa to reduce prices for local consumers. They have also called for investments that would improve local manufacturing capacity and remove barriers to local production so that Africa is less reliant on imported pharmaceuticals.

These are all worthy endeavors, but drug prices are only one part of the challenge when it comes to expanding and ensuring access to medications. Improving supply chain capacity and investing in baseline public health systems are also key components of improving access. Thus far, the international community has demonstrated that it can quickly marshal resources in response to specific health crises in Africa, but setting up and maintaining durable public health infrastructure just hasn’t happened.

<blockquote>
We see a growing hostility towards migrants from the Horn of Africa in South Africa, as well as mistreatment of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa in North Africa.  Do you think it is hypocritical of these African countries to reject South-South migration while at the same time criticizing European powers for their role in migrant deaths? What platform do you think Africans should use to address this rejection of South-South migration, and what methods do you think will be most successful in remedying the issue? 
</blockquote>

As your question implies, many of the international debates regarding migration and the need to “manage migration” focus primarily on irregular migration from the global south to the global north. But many states in the global south are also grappling with the question of how to manage irregular migration.

The 1951 Refugee Convention clearly states that people have the right to seek asylum. There are some competing interpretations of who should count as an asylum seeker and under what conditions, but few argue that people should not have the right to seek asylum. And yet, we are seeing a global trend in which states increasingly construct legal, administrative, and physical barriers to prevent people from exercising their right to seek asylum. African countries are no exception, and many of the discourses around “security” and “migration management” within Africa have the same xenophobic subtext we see elsewhere.

While many of the most militarized and violent borders in the world are those that separate the “Global North” from the “Global South” an increasing number of African countries, particularly those that are “transit” states linking Africa to Europe and the Middle East, are complicit in helping maintain these violent and oppressive border regimes.

It's not my place to say whether or not the actions of South Africa and various North African countries are hypocritical, but I am very comfortable stating that the ways in which these states are failing to live up to their obligations under international law is shameful.
