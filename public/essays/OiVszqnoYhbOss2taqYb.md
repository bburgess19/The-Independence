the danger of doing nothing  
We stand on the shoulders of those who came before  
Forever in debt to their name  
We live in the time that they fought for  
Our lives, a gift they could only imagine,  
This, we, are the product of what they marched to ensure,  
Built from resistance, and passion.  
The danger of doing nothing looms even so close  
In these yet to be united states, where hate still flows  

We live in debt to the ancestors who were denied  
To stand still now is to betray their pride,  
To let keep them from their hard-won light  
Their dreams deferred, their voices cast aside.  

We are the bridge from past to new,  
And in our hands, their dreams come true.  
The sound of ballots being punched,  
Becomes the music they died to listen to  

The rhythm of change, it is true,  
In these yet to be united states  
We can finally be heard, no longer mute  
They are scared of us, scared of our choice  
But don't be perturbed, let them hear your voice,  
There's a reason they tell you it matters so little  
Because your voice is strong, not brittle  

So don't let the danger of doing nothing take hold  
It is not our time to be bold
